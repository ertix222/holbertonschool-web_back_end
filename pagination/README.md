# Pagination

Pagination is the process of splitting a large set of data into smaller, manageable chunks called pages.  
It is commonly used in APIs, websites, and applications to improve performance, user experience, and readability.

For example, instead of returning 1,000 items at once, a paginated system may return 20 items per page,  
allowing clients to request the specific page they need.

This project demonstrates the basics of pagination logic, including how to calculate index ranges for given pages.
